# SLAM-Simultaneous-Localization-and-Mapping
 Project coding a toy SLAM implementation in python for fun and learning


Currently the project is able to produce a simple video player for a test video file and then extract features from that video and visualise the extracted features as they are tracked frame to frame. These are only prepatory steps for the implementation of localization and mapping components.
